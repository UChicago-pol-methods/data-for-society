## Principal Investigator

### Molly Offer-Westort
*Principal Investigator*

Molly Offer-Westort integrates machine learning methods with experimental design to answer causal questions. She also has an ongoing substantive research program that examines online behavior to understand how people change their views and attitudes in response to the conversations they take part in and the information they engage with online. She combines these agendas in social media experiments, using approaches like adaptive assignment and policy learning, and incorporating natural language processing methods for flexible conversational interventions.
